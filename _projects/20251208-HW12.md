# Problem Description

(Following HW5 Portfolio) The bar in your mechanism is no longer rigid. In fact, it is now best described as a beam which bends due to the combined action of the weight and the actuator force. Consider only the components of these forces transverse to your beam:

a) Find the maximum deflection in your beam. State your assumptions clearly and
describe your analysis.
b) Choose a beam design (cross-section, material) such that its vertical deflection is
below 2% of its length and is the most mass-efficient possible.
c) Present your final beam design in an image or drawing.

# Objective

Choose appropriate cross-section and material for the beam design so that y is less than 2%l and cross-sectional area is at minimum

# Solution

## Part a)

1) FBD of the bar at initial position, considering actuator force and the mass attached at the end, neglecting the bar's self weight since it will be a lot smaller compared to the mass it is lifting
2) using Appendix E in the textbook, maximum deflection is -PL^3/3EI

## Part b)

1) maximum deflection should be less than 0.02 * 50 = 1cm
2) find an appropriate combination of E and I
