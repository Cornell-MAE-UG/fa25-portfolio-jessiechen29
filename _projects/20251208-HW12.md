# Problem Description

(Following HW5 Portfolio) The bar in your mechanism is no longer rigid. In fact, it is now best described as a beam which bends due to the combined action of the weight and the actuator force. Consider only the components of these forces transverse to your beam:

a) Find the maximum deflection in your beam. State your assumptions clearly and
describe your analysis.
b) Choose a beam design (cross-section, material) such that its vertical deflection is
below 2% of its length and is the most mass-efficient possible.
c) Present your final beam design in an image or drawing.

**Original Design:**

# Objective

Choose appropriate cross-section and material for the beam design so that Δl is less than 2%l and cross-sectional area is at minimum

# Solution

## Part a)

1) FBD of the bar placed horizontally, considering actuator force and the mass attached at the end, neglecting the bar's self weight since it will be a lot smaller compared to the mass it is lifting
2) 
3)
