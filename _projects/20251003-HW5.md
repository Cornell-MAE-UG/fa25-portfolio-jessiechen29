**Prompt**

Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (your choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from this online catalog, use max force values only), design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height.
Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

**Solution**

Given:

Find:
a frame to lift maximum weight to maximum height

Plan:

1) sketch the lever at maximum lifting

2) FBD of the lever at maximum lifting

3) h_max

4) increase w at h_max

Solution:

when h is at maximum, moving C in -i^ direction, moving AB away from 0, and increasing Ay can increase w

by looking at the catalog, we choose IMA55-RN05 for its thrust and stroke performances, its maximum total length = l + Î”l = 291.8 + 122.9 + 457.2 = 871.9mm = 87.19cm

by merging B and C and drawing OB vertically, we get

Reflection:

In this design, height is at maximum, and weight is also at maximum since bar length is at minimum to lift w to 50cm, so the lever arm for w is at minimum throughout the lifting process and w is at minimum.
