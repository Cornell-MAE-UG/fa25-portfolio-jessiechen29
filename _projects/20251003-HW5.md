# Problem Description

Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (your choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from this online catalog, use max force values only), design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height.
Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

# Objective

Design a frame to lift maximum weight to maximum height

# Design Degree of Freedom

In this design problem, we have one system which can generate three equations, but we have bar length, lifting height, mass, and reactions at the two supports which are more variables that we can solve with three equations, so for the sake of solving this problem, I will set lifting height to the maximum allowable heigth which is the hight of the design space (50cm) and try to optimize the other variables with $h_max$ as a given quantity.

# Solution

1) sketch the lever at maximum lifting

2) FBD of the lever at maximum lifting

3) $h_max$

4) increase w at $h_max$

when h is at maximum, moving C in -i^ direction, moving AB away from 0, and increasing $A_y$ can increase w

by looking at the catalog, we choose IMA55-RN05 for its thrust and stroke performances, its maximum total length = l + Δl = 291.8 + 122.9 + 457.2 = 871.9mm = 87.19cm

by merging B and C and drawing OB vertically, we get the final design
