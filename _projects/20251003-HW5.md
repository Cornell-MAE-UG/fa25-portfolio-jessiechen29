**Prompt**

Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (your choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from this online catalog, use max force values only), design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height.
Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

**Solution**

Given:

Find:
a frame to  lift maximum weight to maximum height

Plan:
1) sketch the lever at maximum lifting
2) FBD of the lever at maximum lifting
3) h_max
4) increase w at h_max

Reflection:
In this design, height is at maximum, and weight is also at maximum since bar length is at minimum to lift w to 50cm, so the lever arm for w is at minimum throughout the lifting process and w is at minimum.
